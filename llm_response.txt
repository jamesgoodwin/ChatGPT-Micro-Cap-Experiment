Given the current market conditions and your existing portfolio, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - With the available cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking into potential micro-cap stocks with growth potential. Please conduct thorough research and identify a promising stock to invest in.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available for the stocks in your portfolio, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels unchanged for now. However, once the price data is available, consider adjusting the stop-loss levels based on the stock's performance.

Remember to conduct in-depth research before making any new investment decisions and ensure that your choices align with your goal of generating maximum return within the specified timeframe. If you have any specific preferences or additional information, feel free to provide them for further customization of your portfolio.
