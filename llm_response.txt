Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data, I recommend holding onto your current positions and maintaining the existing stop-loss levels. Since we do not have real-time market data for your current holdings, it is best to wait for more information before making any changes to the portfolio.

As soon as we have access to updated market data, we can reevaluate the positions and make more informed decisions. In the meantime, it's prudent to stay invested in your current holdings and monitor any developments closely.

Please let me know if you have any specific stocks in mind that you would like to research further or if you would like to adjust your investment strategy in any way.
