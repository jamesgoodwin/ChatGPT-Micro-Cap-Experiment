Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data on the stocks in your portfolio, I recommend the following actions:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47

2. Buy new positions (with available cash):
   - Since you have a limited cash balance of $7.43, I recommend holding onto the cash for now until we have more information on the market and individual stock performance.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Given the lack of current price data, it is difficult to determine if the existing stop-loss levels are appropriate. I recommend keeping an eye on the market and adjusting the stop-loss levels accordingly once the data becomes available.

Overall, the best course of action at this time is to hold onto your current positions and keep a close watch on any developments in the market. Feel free to reach out for further updates or adjustments as needed.
