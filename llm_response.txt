Based on the current portfolio status and market conditions, here are my recommendations:

1. **Hold current positions:**
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop at $0.01
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop at $0.01
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop at $0.01
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop at $0.01

2. **Buy new positions:**
   - Since you have a cash balance of $7.43, it might be a good idea to look for new opportunities to invest. I recommend conducting research on potential micro-cap stocks that align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Once you have identified a promising stock, please provide the specific trade details for buying the new position.

3. **Adjust stop-loss levels:**
   - Given the current market conditions and the volatility of micro-cap stocks, it may be prudent to consider adjusting the stop-loss levels for your existing positions. You can reevaluate the risk levels and adjust the stops accordingly to protect your downside.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with any of the above recommendations or if you have any specific preferences for today's trading activity.
