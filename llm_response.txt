Given the current market conditions and the lack of available price data for your current holdings, I recommend the following actions for today:

1. Hold current positions: Since we do not have real-time price data for your current holdings, it is best to maintain your existing positions until we can assess the market conditions more accurately.

2. Monitor the market closely: Keep a close eye on the market and any news or developments that could impact micro-cap stocks. Once we have updated price data, we can reevaluate your current holdings and make informed decisions.

3. Stay patient: With limited information available, it is important to exercise patience and avoid making impulsive decisions. Let's wait for more data to make well-informed choices for your portfolio.

Please continue to monitor the market and stay tuned for further updates. If you have any specific stocks in mind or want to explore new opportunities, feel free to provide them for consideration in the next update.
