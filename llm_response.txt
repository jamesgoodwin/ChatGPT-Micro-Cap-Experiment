Given the lack of current price data for your holdings and the market conditions, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions: 
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47

2. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels at $0.01 for each position until we have updated market information.

3. Monitor the market closely and be prepared to make adjustments once price data becomes available.

Please note that with a cash balance of $7.43, you have limited flexibility for new positions at the moment. It would be best to wait for more information before making any significant changes to your portfolio.
