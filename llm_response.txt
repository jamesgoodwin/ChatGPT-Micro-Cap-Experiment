I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. **Hold current positions**:
    - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
    - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
    - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
    - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. **Buy new positions**:
    - Since you have $7.43 in cash, I recommend purchasing shares of a new micro-cap stock. I suggest looking into potential opportunities within the biotech sector, given the market conditions. Conduct thorough research and identify a promising stock to add to your portfolio.

3. **Adjust stop-loss levels**:
    - It's crucial to review and potentially adjust your stop-loss levels for the current holdings. Consider any recent developments or changes in the market that may warrant adjusting the stop-loss levels to manage risk effectively.

Please conduct detailed research and analysis before making any decisions, especially when buying new positions. Remember to update your portfolio with precise order details and rationale for each trade. 

Thesis Review for Next Week: Continue to monitor the performance of existing positions, look for new opportunities in the micro-cap space, and maintain a focus on generating alpha within the specified timeframe.
