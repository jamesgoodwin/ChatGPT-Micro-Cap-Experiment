I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions as there is no current price data available to assess their performance.

2. With a cash balance of $7.43, consider buying new positions to diversify your portfolio further. 

3. Look for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth prospects and catalysts that could drive positive returns within your specified timeframe.

4. If any of your current holdings reach your stop-loss levels or if there are negative developments in the company, consider selling those positions to minimize losses.

5. Keep a close eye on market conditions and news related to micro-cap stocks to make informed decisions for your portfolio.

Please ensure to conduct thorough research before making any trades and consider the risk factors associated with micro-cap stocks. Good luck with your portfolio management!
