Given the lack of current price data for the stocks in your portfolio and the market indices, it is challenging to provide a detailed analysis. However, I would recommend the following based on the information available:

1. Hold current positions: Since we don't have the most recent price data, it's prudent to hold onto your current positions until we have more information on their performance.

2. Monitor stop-loss levels: Given the volatile nature of micro-cap stocks, it's important to regularly review and potentially adjust your stop-loss levels once we have access to updated pricing information.

3. Keep an eye on market conditions: While we don't have real-time market data, it's essential to stay informed about any major developments or trends that could impact your portfolio.

Once we have access to updated market data, we can reassess your portfolio and make more informed decisions. Please let me know if you would like more specific recommendations or if you have any other questions.
