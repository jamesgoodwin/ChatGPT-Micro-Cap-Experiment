Given the current market conditions and your portfolio status, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: Continue holding 5 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01 (No current price data).
   - BETR: Continue holding 1 share with a stop-loss at $0.01 (No current price data).
   - CCLD: Continue holding 25 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01 (No current price data).
   - CSBR: Continue holding 3 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01 (No current price data).

2. Buy new positions:
   - Based on your cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential to diversify your portfolio. Conduct thorough research and identify a promising stock that aligns with your investment strategy.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since we do not have current price data for your holdings, I recommend maintaining the existing stop-loss levels until we have updated information on the stock prices.

Please ensure to conduct detailed research before making any new investment decisions. Let me know if you need further assistance or specific recommendations for potential new positions.
