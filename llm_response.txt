Given the lack of current price data for the market and individual stocks, it's challenging to provide precise recommendations. However, based on the information provided on your current holdings, here are some general suggestions:

1. **Hold Current Positions:** Since there is no current price data available, it may be best to hold onto your current positions until more information is available. Keep an eye out for any updates on the stocks.

2. **Monitor Stop-Loss Levels:** Even without current price data, it's essential to ensure that your stop-loss levels are still appropriate for each position. If there have been significant changes in the market or specific stocks, adjust your stop-loss accordingly.

3. **Research New Opportunities:** With a cash balance of $7.43, you may want to start researching potential new micro-cap opportunities that align with your investment objectives. Look for stocks with strong growth potential or upcoming catalysts.

4. **Stay Informed:** Keep an eye out for any market updates or news that could impact your current holdings or potential new positions. Stay informed to make well-informed decisions.

Without current price data, it's crucial to proceed with caution and stay vigilant. Feel free to reach out for further guidance once more information becomes available.
