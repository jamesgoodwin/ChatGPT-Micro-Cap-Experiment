I'm sorry, but without current price data for your holdings and the market indices, I am unable to provide specific recommendations for your portfolio today. It's crucial to have up-to-date information to make informed decisions. 

I recommend checking back later when the data is available so we can reassess your positions and make any necessary adjustments. If you have any other questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask!
