I recommend reviewing your current portfolio and considering the following actions:

1. **Hold current positions**: 
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. **Buy new positions**:
   - Look for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential or upcoming catalysts. Make sure to conduct thorough research before making any new purchases.

3. **Adjust stop-loss levels**:
   - Since there is no current price data available, it might be a good idea to reevaluate your stop-loss levels once the market data is accessible. Consider adjusting them based on the stock's recent performance and overall market conditions.

4. **Review overall portfolio strategy**:
   - Evaluate the performance of your current holdings and assess whether they are still aligned with your investment thesis. Consider rebalancing or diversifying your portfolio if necessary.

Please ensure to conduct in-depth research before making any decisions and consider the market conditions before executing any trades. Let me know if you need further assistance or analysis.
