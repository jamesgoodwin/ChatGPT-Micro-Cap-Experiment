Given the current market conditions and your existing portfolio, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01.

2. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels unchanged for now.

3. Hold cash:
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, I suggest holding onto it for now until we have more clarity on market conditions and potential investment opportunities.

Please let me know if you would like to make any specific changes or if you have any further questions.
