I recommend reviewing your current positions and considering potential adjustments given the lack of current price data for your holdings. Since there is no available market data, it might be challenging to make informed decisions at this moment.

If you have any specific insights or research on the micro-cap stocks in your portfolio, I suggest revisiting the thesis behind each investment to determine if they still align with your objectives. Without updated price information, it may be prudent to hold off on making any immediate changes until the market data becomes available.

In the meantime, you can continue monitoring the market conditions and be prepared to act swiftly once the data is accessible. If you have any further research or analysis on potential new positions, it would be beneficial to prepare for any upcoming opportunities in the market.

Please let me know if you have any additional information or if you would like to discuss any specific aspects of your portfolio further.
