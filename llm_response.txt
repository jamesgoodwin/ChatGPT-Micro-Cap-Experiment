Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data, I recommend holding onto your current positions for now. 

However, since you have a relatively small cash balance of $7.43, I suggest waiting for more market data to become available before making any new purchases. 

If you have any specific insights or updates on the stocks in your portfolio, please share them so we can make more informed decisions in the future.
