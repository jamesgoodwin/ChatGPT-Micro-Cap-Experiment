I am a professional-grade portfolio analyst. 

Given the current market conditions and the status of your portfolio, here are my recommendations for today:

1. **Hold current positions:** 
    - ATYR: Hold the 5 shares at $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
    - BETR: Hold the 1 share at $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
    - CCLD: Hold the 25 shares at $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
    - CSBR: Hold the 3 shares at $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01.

2. **Buy new positions:** 
    - With a cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential new micro-cap stocks to invest in. Conduct thorough research and identify a promising opportunity that aligns with your investment goals.

3. **Adjust stop-loss levels:** 
    - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend maintaining the existing stop-loss levels for now. Keep an eye on the market and be prepared to adjust the stop-loss levels accordingly when price data becomes available.

Please ensure that any new investments align with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Keep a close watch on market developments and be prepared to make adjustments as needed.
