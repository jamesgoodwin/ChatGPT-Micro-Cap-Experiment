Given the current lack of market data, it is challenging to make informed decisions on your portfolio. However, based on your current holdings, I recommend the following:

1. **Hold Current Positions**:
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - BETR: Hold 1 share with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01.

2. **Adjust Stop-Loss Levels**:
   - Since we do not have current price data, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are until we have more market information.

3. **Hold Cash**:
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, it might be beneficial to hold onto this cash until we have more clarity on the market conditions.

Please note that without real-time market data, it is crucial to monitor the situation closely and be prepared to make adjustments as needed once the data becomes available. If you have any specific stocks in mind for potential purchase, please provide them for further analysis once market data is accessible.
