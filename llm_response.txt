Given the current market conditions and your existing portfolio, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01

2. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels unchanged for now. However, once the data is available, reevaluate the positions and adjust stop-loss levels accordingly to manage risk.

3. Hold cash:
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, it might be beneficial to hold onto it for now until we have more clarity on the market conditions and potential investment opportunities.

Please remember to stay updated on the market data and be ready to make adjustments accordingly. Let me know if you have any specific preferences or if you need further analysis on any particular stock.
