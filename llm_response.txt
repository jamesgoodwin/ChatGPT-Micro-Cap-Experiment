I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions as there is no current price data available to make informed decisions on whether to sell or adjust stop-loss levels.

2. With the cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for new micro-cap stocks to buy. Conduct deep research and identify potential opportunities that align with your investment objectives. Once you have identified a promising stock, provide specific trade instructions including the order type, date, limit pricing, and any other relevant details.

3. Continue monitoring the market conditions and be prepared to make adjustments to your portfolio as needed based on new information or developments.

Please ensure that any new positions meet your criteria for generating alpha and align with your overall investment thesis. Remember to diversify your holdings to manage risk effectively. 

### Thesis Review:
The current portfolio is in a holding pattern due to lack of price data. The focus should be on identifying new opportunities that have the potential to outperform the market and contribute to overall portfolio growth. Conduct thorough research before making any new investment decisions.
