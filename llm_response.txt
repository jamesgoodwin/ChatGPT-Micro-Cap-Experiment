Given the lack of current price data for your existing holdings and the overall market, I recommend taking a cautious approach today. 

Since your cash balance is low at $7.43, I recommend holding onto your current positions until we have more market data. 

I suggest conducting a thorough analysis of potential new micro-cap stocks to invest in once we have more information. 

Please continue to monitor the market closely and be prepared to act accordingly as more data becomes available. 

Thesis review: Continue to monitor current positions while researching new potential micro-cap stocks for future investment opportunities.
