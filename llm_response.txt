Given the limited information available, here are my recommendations for your current portfolio:

1. ATYR: Hold
2. BETR: Hold
3. CCLD: Hold
4. CSBR: Hold

With the market data being unavailable, it is challenging to make informed decisions on buying or selling new positions. I recommend holding onto your current positions for now until we have more market data to analyze. Keep a close eye on any news or developments related to the companies in your portfolio that could impact their stock prices.

If you have any specific preferences or criteria for new buys, please provide them so that I can tailor my recommendations accordingly. Let me know if you would like me to review your portfolio again once market data becomes available.
