Given the current market conditions and the lack of specific price data for our holdings, I recommend the following actions for our portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
- ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90
- BETR: 1 share @ $13.78
- CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59
- CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47

2. Adjust stop-loss levels:
- Since we don't have updated price data, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels at $0.01 for all positions until we have more information.

3. Hold cash balance:
- With a cash balance of $7.43, it's always good to have some liquidity on hand for potential opportunities in the future.

Please note that without current price data, it's challenging to make specific buy, sell, or adjust stop-loss recommendations. Once we have updated information, we can reassess the portfolio and make more informed decisions.
