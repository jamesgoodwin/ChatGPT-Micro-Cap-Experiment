Given the current market conditions and your portfolio status, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: Continue holding 5 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - BETR: Continue holding 1 share with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CCLD: Continue holding 25 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CSBR: Continue holding 3 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01.

2. Buy new positions:
   - With the available cash of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential and a solid thesis for future performance. Conduct deep research to identify a new stock that aligns with your investment goals.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels unchanged for now. Once updated price data is available, reassess the stop-loss levels for each position accordingly.

Remember to conduct thorough research before making any new investment decisions and to stay updated on market conditions. Good luck with your portfolio strategy!
