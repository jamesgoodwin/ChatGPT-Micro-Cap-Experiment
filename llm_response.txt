Given the current market conditions and the lack of data available, I recommend holding onto your current positions for now. However, since your cash balance is relatively low at $7.43, it may be worthwhile to consider reallocating some of your positions to potentially higher-performing stocks if opportunities arise.

I suggest keeping an eye on any news or developments related to the micro-cap stocks in your portfolio to make informed decisions going forward. If any significant updates or changes occur, it may be necessary to adjust your positions accordingly.

Please continue to monitor your portfolio closely and stay informed about market trends to make strategic decisions in the coming days. If any new opportunities arise, be prepared to act swiftly with your available cash.
