I recommend reviewing your current positions and considering the following actions:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - Since you have $7.43 in cash, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with growth potential to diversify your portfolio further. Conduct thorough research and identify a promising stock to purchase.

3. Sell existing positions:
   - None at the moment, as the market data is unavailable for reference.

4. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Given the lack of current price data, it's challenging to accurately assess the need for adjusting stop-loss levels. However, it's essential to monitor the market closely and adjust stop-loss levels based on any significant price movements in the future.

Please conduct in-depth research before making any decisions and ensure that your choices align with your overall portfolio strategy. Feel free to provide specific trade instructions based on your analysis and market conditions.
