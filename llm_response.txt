I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. **Hold current positions:**
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. **Adjust stop-loss levels:**
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend adjusting the stop-loss levels based on the previous closing prices to protect your positions.

3. **Buy new positions:**
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, you have the opportunity to add to your portfolio. I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential and conducting thorough research before making any new purchases.

Overall, I suggest maintaining a diversified portfolio with a focus on risk management and potential for alpha generation in the micro-cap space. Keep a close eye on market conditions and be prepared to adjust your positions accordingly.
