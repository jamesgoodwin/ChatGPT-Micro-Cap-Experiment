Given the current market conditions and your current portfolio status, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01

2. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are until we have updated market information.

3. Hold cash position:
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, it might be beneficial to hold onto this cash for potential opportunities that may arise in the market.

Please note that without current market data, it is challenging to make precise recommendations regarding buying or selling new positions. I recommend monitoring the market closely and being prepared to act swiftly once data becomes available. 

Please let me know if you would like to make any specific adjustments to your portfolio based on these recommendations.
