Given the current portfolio status and market conditions, here are my recommendations for today:

1. **Hold current positions:**
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop at $0.01.
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop at $0.01.
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop at $0.01.
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop at $0.01.

2. **Adjust stop-loss levels:**
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend adjusting the stop-loss levels once the data is accessible. Consider updating the stops based on the latest market conditions to protect gains and manage risk.

3. **Use available cash to buy new positions:**
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, consider researching and identifying potential micro-cap stocks with growth potential to invest in. Once you have identified a promising opportunity, provide specific trade instructions including the stock symbol, number of shares to purchase, limit pricing, and any stop-loss levels.

4. **Monitor market data:**
   - Keep an eye on the market conditions and any updates on the Russell 2000, iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF, SPDR S&P Biotech ETF, and S&P 500 indices to make informed decisions regarding your portfolio.

Remember to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any trading decisions. If you have any specific stocks in mind for new positions, please provide the details for further evaluation.
