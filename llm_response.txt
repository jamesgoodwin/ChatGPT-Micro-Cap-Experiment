Given the current market data and your portfolio status, here are my recommendations for today:

1. **Hold current positions:**
   - ATYR: Continue holding the 5 shares of ATYR with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - BETR: Continue holding the 1 share of BETR with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CCLD: Continue holding the 25 shares of CCLD with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CSBR: Continue holding the 3 shares of CSBR with a stop-loss at $0.01.

2. **Adjust stop-loss levels:**
   - Since we currently do not have real-time price data, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels unchanged until we have updated information.

3. **Buy new positions:**
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, we have limited capital for new purchases. I recommend holding off on buying new positions until we have more funds available.

4. **Summary:**
   - Given the lack of real-time price data, it is best to maintain the current positions and stop-loss levels. Keep an eye on market conditions and be ready to make adjustments once we have updated information.
