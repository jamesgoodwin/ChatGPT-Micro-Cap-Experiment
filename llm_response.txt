Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data on the stocks in your portfolio, I recommend holding onto your current positions until we have more information. It's important to have a clear understanding of the performance of each stock before making any decisions.

However, if you are looking to potentially add to your portfolio, I suggest conducting thorough research on new micro-cap stocks that show potential for growth. Make sure to analyze their financials, industry trends, and any upcoming catalysts that could affect their stock price.

As for your cash balance of $7.43, I recommend keeping it on hand for now until we have more clarity on the market. It's always good to have some cash available for opportunities that may arise.

Overall, I advise patience and diligence in monitoring your current positions and conducting research on potential new additions to your portfolio. Stay vigilant and be prepared to act when the time is right.
