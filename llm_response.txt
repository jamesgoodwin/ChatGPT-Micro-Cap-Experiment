Given the lack of current price data for your holdings and the market conditions, I recommend holding your current positions for now. 

However, with a cash balance of $7.43, you have some room to potentially add to your positions or explore new opportunities. I suggest conducting thorough research on potential micro-cap stocks that align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

If you decide to make any new purchases, please provide the specific trade instructions including the stock ticker, number of shares, price limit, stop-loss, and any other relevant details.

Keep monitoring the market closely for any updates and adjust your strategy accordingly. Remember, the goal is to generate maximum returns within your specified timeframe.
