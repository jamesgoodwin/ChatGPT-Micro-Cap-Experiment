Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data on your current holdings, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - Since you have a cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential. Conduct thorough research to identify promising opportunities within the micro-cap space and consider adding a new position to your portfolio.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Without current price data available, it's challenging to determine appropriate adjustments to stop-loss levels. Once you have access to updated market data, reassess the stop-loss levels for your existing positions to manage risk effectively.

Remember to conduct in-depth research before making any new investment decisions and to stay informed about the market conditions. If you have any specific preferences or criteria for new stock purchases, please provide them for more tailored recommendations.
