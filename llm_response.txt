Given the lack of current price data for your holdings and the market conditions, I recommend reviewing your current positions and making adjustments as needed. Here are my recommendations for today:

1. **Hold current positions:** Since there is no updated price data available, it is advisable to hold onto your current positions until we have more information on their performance.

2. **Adjust stop-loss levels:** Consider adjusting the stop-loss levels for your existing positions based on your risk tolerance and any new information you may have.

3. **Research potential new positions:** With a cash balance of $7.43, you have the opportunity to explore new micro-cap stocks that align with your investment strategy. Conduct thorough research before making any new purchases.

Please provide updated price data for your current holdings when available so we can make more informed decisions. Let me know if you would like more specific recommendations or if you have any particular preferences for today's actions.
