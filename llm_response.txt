Given the current market conditions and the limited information available, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Given the lack of current price data, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels unchanged until we have more information on the market conditions.

3. Hold cash balance:
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, I suggest holding onto it for potential future opportunities in the micro-cap market.

Please note that without real-time market data, it's challenging to make precise decisions. I recommend monitoring the market closely for any updates that may impact your portfolio.
