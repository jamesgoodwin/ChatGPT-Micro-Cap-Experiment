I recommend the following actions for your current portfolio:

1. Hold all current positions as there is no current price data available to assess their performance.

2. With the available cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for new micro-cap stocks to buy. Please provide me with a list of potential stocks you are interested in, and I can assist with further analysis and selection.

3. Since there is no market data available, it is challenging to determine the overall market conditions and make informed decisions. I recommend monitoring the market closely for any updates that may impact your portfolio.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with buying new positions or if you have any specific stocks in mind for further analysis.
