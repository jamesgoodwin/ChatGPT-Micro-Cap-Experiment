I recommend reviewing your current positions and considering any adjustments based on market conditions. Since there is no current price data available, it's challenging to make informed decisions. However, given the volatility of micro-cap stocks, it may be prudent to reassess your stop-loss levels and potentially consider diversifying your holdings.

Specific recommendations:
1. Hold current positions until we have more market data available.
2. Consider setting tighter stop-loss levels for your existing positions to manage risk.
3. Keep a close eye on market trends and be prepared to act swiftly once more data becomes available.

Remember, the key to success in micro-cap investing is thorough research and disciplined risk management. Stay vigilant and be prepared to make strategic decisions as needed.
