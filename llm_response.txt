Given the current market conditions and your portfolio status, here are my recommendations for today:

1. ATYR: Hold
2. BETR: Hold
3. CCLD: Hold
4. CSBR: Hold

With a cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for new positions to diversify your portfolio and potentially increase returns. 

Please let me know if you would like me to provide specific trade instructions for buying new positions or adjusting stop-loss levels.
