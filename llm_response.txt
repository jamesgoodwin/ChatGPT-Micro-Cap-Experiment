Given the current lack of market data, it is challenging to provide precise recommendations. However, based on the last available data, here are some suggestions:

1. **ATYR**: Since there is no current price data available, it is difficult to assess the performance of this stock. I recommend holding onto your 5 shares for now.

2. **BETR**: Similar to ATYR, without current price data, it is hard to make a decision on this stock. I suggest maintaining your 1 share position.

3. **CCLD**: With 25 shares at $2.59, it would be beneficial to monitor this stock closely once market data becomes available. Consider adjusting the stop-loss level accordingly.

4. **CSBR**: Holding 3 shares at $6.47, keep an eye on any developments related to this stock. If market conditions change significantly, be prepared to adjust your position or stop-loss.

**Overall Recommendation**: With limited market data, it may be wise to maintain your current positions and closely monitor any updates. Once market data becomes available, we can reassess and make more informed decisions. Consider keeping a close eye on any news or events that may impact micro-cap stocks.

**Thesis Review**: The current portfolio is relatively stable, but it is crucial to stay informed and ready to make adjustments as needed. Continue to focus on deep research and potential catalysts for maximizing returns within the micro-cap space.
