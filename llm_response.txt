Given the lack of current price data for your current holdings and the market conditions, I recommend the following actions:

1. Hold current positions: Since we cannot assess the performance of your current holdings without price data, it would be prudent to hold onto them until we have more information.

2. Buy new positions: With the available cash of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks that show promising growth potential. Conduct deep research on potential candidates and consider diversifying your portfolio further.

3. Monitor market conditions: Keep an eye on the market conditions and be prepared to adjust your positions accordingly once price data becomes available for your current holdings.

Please conduct thorough research on potential new positions and consider the risk-reward ratio before making any new investments. Remember to update your stop-loss levels based on the new information once available.
