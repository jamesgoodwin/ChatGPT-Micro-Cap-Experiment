Given the current market conditions and your existing portfolio, here are my recommendations for today:

1. **Hold Current Positions:**
    - ATYR: Hold 5 shares at $4.90 with a stop at $0.01.
    - BETR: Hold 1 share at $13.78 with a stop at $0.01.
    - CCLD: Hold 25 shares at $2.59 with a stop at $0.01.
    - CSBR: Hold 3 shares at $6.47 with a stop at $0.01.

2. **Adjust Stop-Loss Levels:**
    - Given the lack of current price data, I recommend maintaining the existing stop-loss levels for your holdings.

3. **Buy New Positions:**
    - With a cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential new micro-cap stocks to add to your portfolio. Conduct thorough research and identify stocks with strong growth potential within your specified timeframe.

Please conduct a detailed analysis of potential new positions and provide specific trade instructions if you decide to make any changes to your portfolio. Remember, the goal is to generate maximum returns within the given timeframe.
