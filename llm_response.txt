3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Consider adjusting your stop-loss levels based on any recent developments or changes in the market environment. This will help protect your portfolio from significant losses while allowing for potential upside.

Remember to conduct in-depth research and analysis before making any decisions. Keep a close eye on market trends and news that could impact your portfolio. Good luck with your investments!
