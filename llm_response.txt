Given the current market conditions and your portfolio status, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - With your available cash of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with growth potential based on your research. Once you have identified a promising stock, please provide the specific trade instructions including the stock symbol, number of shares, entry price, and stop-loss level.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the existing stop-loss levels for now. However, once the market data is accessible, consider adjusting the stop-loss levels based on any significant price movements or new information.

Please ensure to conduct thorough research before making any buying or selling decisions. Let me know if you need further assistance or information.
