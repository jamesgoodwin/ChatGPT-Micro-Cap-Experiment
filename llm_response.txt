Based on the current portfolio status and market conditions, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold all current positions as there is no current price data available to make informed decisions on whether to sell or adjust stop-loss levels.

2. With the available cash balance of $7.43, I recommend holding off on buying new positions until we have more market data available to make informed decisions.

3. Continue monitoring the market and be prepared to act once we have more information on the performance of the current holdings and overall market conditions.

Please note that without up-to-date market data, it is best to hold off on making any significant changes to the portfolio at this time.
