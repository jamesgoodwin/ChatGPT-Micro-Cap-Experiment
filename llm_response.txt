Given the current market conditions and the lack of specific price data for your current holdings, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47

2. Buy new positions with available cash ($7.43):
   - Since we are unable to get real-time price data for potential new micro-cap stocks, I suggest holding onto your cash position for now until we have more information on the market.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels (if needed):
   - Since we don't have current price data, it's difficult to assess if stop-loss levels need adjustment. I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are until we have more information.

Please note that without real-time market data, it's challenging to make specific recommendations on buying, selling, or adjusting positions. I recommend monitoring the market closely and being prepared to make decisions based on updated information.
