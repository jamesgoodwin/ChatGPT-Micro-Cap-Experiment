Given the current market conditions and the lack of available price data for your current holdings, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. **Hold current positions**: Since we don't have updated price data, it's best to hold onto your current positions until we have more information.

2. **Buy new positions**: With your available cash of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential. Conduct thorough research to identify promising opportunities.

3. **Adjust stop-loss levels**: Since we can't monitor the current prices, I suggest keeping the stop-loss levels as they are for now. Once we have updated price data, we can reassess and adjust the stop-loss levels accordingly.

Remember to conduct thorough research on any new potential investments and consider diversifying your portfolio to manage risk effectively. Let me know if you need further assistance or specific recommendations.
