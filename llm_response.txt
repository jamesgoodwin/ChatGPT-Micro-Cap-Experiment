Given the lack of current price data and market information, I recommend holding onto your current positions until we have more clarity on the market conditions. 

If you have any specific stocks in mind that you would like to research and potentially add to your portfolio, please let me know so I can assist you in conducting a deep analysis. 

As always, remember to keep a close eye on your stop-loss levels and adjust them accordingly based on any new information that may arise. 

Feel free to reach out with any specific instructions or requests for further analysis.
