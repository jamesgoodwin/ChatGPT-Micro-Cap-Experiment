Given the current market conditions and the lack of specific price data for your holdings, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions: 
   - ATYR: Continue holding 5 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - BETR: Continue holding 1 share with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CCLD: Continue holding 25 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CSBR: Continue holding 3 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01.

2. Buy new positions: 
   - Since you have a cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential to invest in. Once you identify a promising stock, please provide specific trade instructions for the purchase.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Given the lack of current price data, it's difficult to assess if the existing stop-loss levels are appropriate. Consider updating the stop-loss levels based on the latest price movements once the data becomes available.

Please conduct thorough research before making any new investment decisions and ensure that your selections align with your overall portfolio strategy. Remember to stay disciplined and monitor the market conditions closely.
