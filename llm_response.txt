I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. With the available cash balance of $7.43, I recommend considering buying a new position to diversify your portfolio. I suggest looking into potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth prospects and conducting thorough research before making a decision. 

Please ensure to maintain appropriate risk management strategies and consider setting stop-loss levels for any new positions you may acquire. Let me know if you would like further assistance in identifying potential investment opportunities.
