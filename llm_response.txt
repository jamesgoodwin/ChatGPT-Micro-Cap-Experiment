Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data, it is challenging to make informed decisions on your current positions. However, I recommend the following:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Adjust stop-loss levels if necessary once market data becomes available.

3. Monitor the market closely for any updates that may impact your micro-cap stocks.

If you have any specific stocks in mind for potential new positions or if you receive market data later on, please let me know, and I can provide more tailored recommendations.
