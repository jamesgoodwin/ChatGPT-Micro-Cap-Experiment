Given the current market conditions and the lack of available market data, I recommend holding onto your current positions as there is not enough information to make informed decisions on buying, selling, or adjusting stop-loss levels. 

Please continue to monitor the market closely and be prepared to make adjustments once more data becomes available. It's important to stay patient and not make impulsive decisions without proper information. 

If you have any specific questions or would like further guidance on your portfolio, please let me know.
