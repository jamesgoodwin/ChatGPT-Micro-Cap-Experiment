Given the current market conditions and the lack of specific price data for your holdings, I recommend the following actions:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop at $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop at $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop at $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop at $0.01

2. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since we don't have current price data, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are until we can assess the market conditions more accurately.

3. Hold cash balance:
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, it's best to hold onto it for now until we have more information on potential new positions or adjustments to current holdings.

Please note that without specific price data, it's challenging to make precise recommendations. I suggest monitoring the market closely and being prepared to act swiftly once we have more information.
