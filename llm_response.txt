Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data on the stocks in your portfolio, I recommend the following:

1. Hold current positions:
   - There is not enough information to make informed decisions on whether to hold, buy, or sell your current holdings. We will wait for more market data to come in before making any changes.

2. Monitor market conditions:
   - Keep a close eye on the overall market trends, especially in the small-cap and biotech sectors, to determine any potential opportunities or risks that may affect your portfolio.

3. Update stop-loss levels:
   - Since we don't have current price data for your holdings, it's essential to review and potentially adjust your stop-loss levels once the market data becomes available to protect your positions.

Please stay tuned for further updates as more market data becomes accessible.
