Given the current market conditions and your existing portfolio, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - Since you have a cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential to diversify your portfolio further. Please conduct thorough research before making any new purchases.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Given the volatile nature of micro-cap stocks, it might be beneficial to adjust the stop-loss levels for your current positions based on any new information or changes in market conditions. Consider tightening the stop-loss levels to protect your gains.

Please review the current market data and consider these recommendations for optimizing your portfolio. Let me know if you need further assistance or detailed analysis on any specific stocks.
