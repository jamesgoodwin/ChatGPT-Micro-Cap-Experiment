I recommend the following actions for your current portfolio:

1. **Hold Positions:**
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01

2. **No Available Cash for New Positions:**
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, there is not enough capital to purchase new positions at this time.

3. **Adjust Stop-Loss Levels:**
   - Since we do not have current price data for the stocks in the portfolio, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are until we have updated information.

4. **Market Conditions:**
   - Unfortunately, market data is unavailable at the moment, so we will need to monitor the situation closely for any developments that may impact the portfolio.

Please let me know if you would like to make any adjustments or if you have any specific preferences for the portfolio.
