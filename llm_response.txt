Based on the current portfolio status and market conditions, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold all current positions as there is no current price data available to make informed decisions on selling or adjusting stop-loss levels.

2. With the available cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for new micro-cap stocks to buy. Conduct thorough research on potential candidates with strong growth prospects and consider diversifying the portfolio to maximize returns.

Please provide specific details on any new positions you decide to purchase, including the stock ticker, number of shares, purchase price, and any stop-loss levels. Remember to focus on generating alpha in the portfolio.
