I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - Look for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential and catalysts in the biotech sector to diversify your portfolio further and maximize returns.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as is until we have updated information on the stock prices.

Please ensure to conduct thorough research before making any new investment decisions and consider diversifying your portfolio to manage risk effectively. Let me know if you need further assistance or information.
