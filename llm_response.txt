Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data, it is challenging to make informed decisions on your portfolio. However, based on the information provided, here are some recommendations:

1. **Hold current positions:** Since we do not have updated price data for your current holdings, it is advisable to hold onto your existing positions until we have more information on how the market is performing.

2. **Adjust stop-loss levels:** As we do not have current price data, it is difficult to assess whether the stop-loss levels are appropriate. Once we have access to updated market data, we can reevaluate and adjust the stop-loss levels accordingly.

3. **Monitor market conditions:** Given the uncertainty surrounding the market data, it would be prudent to closely monitor market conditions and be prepared to make adjustments to your portfolio once more information is available.

Please note that these recommendations are based on the limited information provided. Once we have access to updated market data, we can reassess the portfolio and make more informed decisions.
