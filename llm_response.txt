Given the current market conditions with unavailable data, it is difficult to make informed decisions on your existing positions. However, with your available cash balance of $7.43, I recommend considering the following:

1. **Hold Current Positions:** Since we don't have current price data for your holdings (ATYR, BETR, CCLD, CSBR), it might be prudent to hold onto them until we have more information on their performance.

2. **Buy New Positions:** With your cash balance, you may consider looking into potential new micro-cap stocks to add to your portfolio. Conduct thorough research on companies with strong growth potential and consider initiating new positions.

3. **Adjust Stop-Loss Levels:** Given the volatile nature of micro-cap stocks, consider adjusting your stop-loss levels for existing positions once we have updated price data to better manage risk.

4. **Monitor Market Data:** Keep an eye on market conditions and any available data on small caps, biotech ETFs, and the broader market indices to inform your decision-making process.

Please conduct further research on potential new additions to your portfolio and adjust your stop-loss levels accordingly once we have more information. Stay proactive in managing your portfolio to maximize returns within the given timeframe.
