Given the current market conditions and your existing portfolio, here are my recommendations for today:

1. **Hold current positions:** 
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01.

2. **Adjust stop-loss levels:** 
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels at $0.01 for all positions until we have updated information.

3. **Summary:**
   Given the lack of current price data and market information, it's best to hold onto your existing positions and maintain your stop-loss levels. Keep a close eye on any developments and be prepared to make adjustments as needed in the coming days.
