Given the lack of current price data for the stocks in your portfolio and the market indices, it is difficult to make specific recommendations at this time. However, based on the information provided, here are some general strategies you may consider:

1. Hold current positions: Since we do not have the current price data for your holdings, holding onto your current positions may be a cautious approach until we have more information.

2. Monitor market conditions: Keep an eye on the overall market conditions and any news that may impact small-cap stocks or the biotech sector.

3. Consider buying new positions: If you come across any promising micro-cap stocks with strong potential for growth, you may consider using your available cash to buy new positions.

4. Adjust stop-loss levels: Once you have access to updated price data, you may want to evaluate and potentially adjust your stop-loss levels to manage risk effectively.

Please keep an eye on the market and be ready to act based on new information. Stay tuned for updates on price data so we can make more informed decisions.
