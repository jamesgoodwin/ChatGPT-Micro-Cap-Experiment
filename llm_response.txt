Given the current market conditions and the lack of specific price data, it is challenging to make precise recommendations for your portfolio. However, based on your current holdings and the fact that the market data is unavailable, here are some general suggestions:

1. Hold current positions: Since we cannot assess the performance of your current holdings without price data, it might be wise to hold onto your positions until we have more information.

2. Monitor closely: Keep a close eye on the market and your portfolio. As soon as the price data becomes available, reassess the performance of your holdings and make decisions accordingly.

3. Consider diversification: With a limited number of holdings in your portfolio, it might be beneficial to look for opportunities to diversify further if the price data indicates any weakness in your current positions.

4. Stay patient: In situations where information is lacking, it is crucial to remain patient and avoid making impulsive decisions. Wait for more data to become available before taking any significant actions.

Once we have access to updated price data, we can conduct a more thorough analysis and provide more specific recommendations for your portfolio. Please stay tuned for further updates.
