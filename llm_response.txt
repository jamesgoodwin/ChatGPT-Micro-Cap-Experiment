Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data, I recommend holding onto your current positions. We will need more information on the market performance to make informed decisions on whether to buy, sell, or adjust stop-loss levels. 

I suggest waiting for more clarity on the market data before making any changes to the portfolio. Please stay updated on the market conditions and be ready to act accordingly once the data becomes available.
