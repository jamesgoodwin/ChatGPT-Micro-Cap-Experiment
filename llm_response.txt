Given the current market conditions and the lack of data available, I recommend holding onto your current positions for now. Without real-time market information, it is difficult to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or adjusting stop-loss levels. 

I suggest monitoring the market closely and being prepared to act swiftly once data becomes available. In the meantime, it may be prudent to maintain your current positions and wait for more clarity before making any changes. 

Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or additional information that may impact your decision-making process.
