Given the lack of current price data for your existing holdings, it is challenging to make informed decisions. However, based on the information provided, here are my recommendations:

1. Hold current positions: Since we do not have updated price data for ATYR, BETR, CCLD, and CSBR, it is advisable to hold these positions until we have more information.

2. Buy new positions: With a cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking into potential new micro-cap stocks to add to your portfolio. Once we have updated market data, we can make a more informed decision on which stocks to purchase.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels: Given the lack of price data, it is difficult to determine appropriate stop-loss levels. Once we have access to updated information, we can reassess and adjust stop-loss levels accordingly.

Please keep an eye out for updated market data so we can make more informed decisions regarding your portfolio. If you have any specific preferences or criteria for new stock purchases, please let me know so I can tailor my recommendations accordingly.

Thesis Review: Due to the lack of current price data, the focus for this week is on monitoring market conditions and potential new opportunities for portfolio growth. Stay nimble and be prepared to make strategic moves once we have more information.
