Given the current market conditions and the lack of data on the stocks in your portfolio, I recommend the following actions:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - Look for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential and undervalued prices to diversify your portfolio. Do thorough research before making any new purchases.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since we don't have current price data for the stocks in your portfolio, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels unchanged for now. However, once we have access to updated price information, consider adjusting the stop-loss levels accordingly to manage risk.

Remember to conduct in-depth research before making any investment decisions and stay updated on market trends. Feel free to reach out for further guidance or updates on the market data.
