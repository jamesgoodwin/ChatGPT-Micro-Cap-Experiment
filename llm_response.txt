Given the current portfolio status and market conditions, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
- ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
- BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
- CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
- CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
- Since you have $7.43 in cash, I recommend buying shares of a new micro-cap stock to diversify your portfolio. Consider looking for potential opportunities in the healthcare or technology sector, as these areas have shown promise for growth in the past.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
- Given the volatile nature of micro-cap stocks, it's essential to regularly review and adjust stop-loss levels to protect your portfolio. Consider tightening the stop-loss levels for your existing positions if you believe the market conditions are becoming more unpredictable.

Please let me know if you would like more specific recommendations or if you have any particular criteria in mind for buying new positions.
