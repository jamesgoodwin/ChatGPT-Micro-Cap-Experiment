Based on the current market conditions and your portfolio status, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
- ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
- BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
- CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
- CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01.

2. Adjust stop-loss levels:
- Since there is no current price data available for your holdings, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels unchanged for now until we have more information on the market conditions.

3. Hold cash balance:
- With a cash balance of $7.43, I recommend holding onto it for now until we have more clarity on potential new investment opportunities.

Please let me know if you would like to make any specific adjustments or if you have any additional information to consider for future decisions.
