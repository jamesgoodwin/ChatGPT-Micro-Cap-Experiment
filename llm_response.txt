Given the current lack of market data, it is challenging to make informed decisions regarding your portfolio. However, based on the information available, here are my recommendations:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47

2. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend maintaining the stop-loss levels at $0.01 for all positions until we have access to updated market information.

3. Monitor market conditions closely and be prepared to act swiftly once data becomes available. Consider conducting thorough research on potential new micro-cap stocks to capitalize on any emerging opportunities.

Please note that these recommendations are based on the limited information provided. It is essential to stay vigilant and adapt your strategy accordingly as market conditions evolve.
