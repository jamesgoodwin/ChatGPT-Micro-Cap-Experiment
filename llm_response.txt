Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data on the portfolio holdings, I recommend the following actions:

1. Hold all current positions: ATYR, BETR, CCLD, and CSBR.
2. Consider looking for new micro-cap stocks to invest in with the available cash balance of $7.43.
3. Since there is no current price data available, I suggest waiting for updated information before making any changes to the portfolio.

Please continue to monitor the market closely for any updates and adjust your portfolio accordingly when more information becomes available.
