Given the current market conditions and your existing portfolio, here are my recommendations for today:

1. **Hold current positions**: 
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares at $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - BETR: Hold 1 share at $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares at $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares at $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01.

2. **Adjust stop-loss levels**:
   - I recommend adjusting the stop-loss levels for all positions to reflect any new price movements.

3. **Buy new positions**:
   - Unfortunately, with only $7.43 in cash, it may not be feasible to buy new positions at this time.

Overall, I suggest monitoring the market closely and adjusting your stop-loss levels accordingly to protect your positions. If you have any specific stocks in mind for potential purchases, please let me know so we can evaluate them further.
