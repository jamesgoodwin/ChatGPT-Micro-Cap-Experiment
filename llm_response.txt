Given the lack of current price data for your holdings and the market conditions, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since we don't have current price data, I suggest keeping the stop-loss levels as is for now. Once we have updated pricing information, we can reassess and potentially adjust the stop-loss levels accordingly.

3. Hold cash balance:
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, it might be beneficial to keep some liquidity for potential future opportunities in the micro-cap market.

Please note that without current price data, it's challenging to make precise recommendations. Once we have access to updated market information, we can revisit the portfolio and make more informed decisions.
