Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data on your current holdings, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47

2. Buy new positions with available cash:
   - Since you have a limited cash balance of $7.43, I recommend holding off on buying new positions for now and focusing on maximizing the potential of your existing holdings.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Given the lack of current price data, it's difficult to assess the performance of your current holdings. I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are until we have more information to make informed decisions.

Overall, I suggest monitoring the market closely and staying updated on any developments that may impact your portfolio. It's important to remain patient and strategic in your approach to maximize returns within the given timeframe.
