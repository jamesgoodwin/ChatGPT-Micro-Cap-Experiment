Given the current market conditions and the status of your portfolio, here are my recommendations for today:

1. **Hold current positions**: Since there is no current price data available for your holdings, it is difficult to make an informed decision on whether to hold or sell. Therefore, I recommend holding your current positions until we have updated pricing information.

2. **Adjust stop-loss levels**: Since we do not have current price data, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are for now. Once we have access to updated pricing information, we can reevaluate and adjust stop-loss levels accordingly.

3. **Monitor market data**: Although we do not have access to real-time market data, it is important to stay informed about the overall market conditions, especially for micro-cap stocks. Keep an eye on the Russell 2000, iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF, SPDR S&P Biotech ETF, and S&P 500 to gauge the overall market sentiment.

Please note that without real-time data, our ability to make precise recommendations is limited. Once we have access to updated pricing information, we can reassess and make more informed decisions. Stay vigilant and be prepared to act accordingly based on new developments in the market.
