Given the lack of current price data for your holdings and market indices, it is difficult to provide specific recommendations at this time. However, it is important to conduct a thorough analysis of your current positions and market conditions to make informed decisions.

Since you have a small cash balance of $7.43, it may be challenging to make significant changes to your portfolio. I recommend focusing on potential opportunities in the micro-cap space that align with your investment strategy.

If you have access to updated price data later on, consider reassessing your current holdings to ensure they still meet your criteria for maximum return potential. Additionally, keep an eye on any market developments or news that could impact your portfolio.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or if there are specific stocks you are interested in exploring for potential investment.
