I recommend holding your current positions as there is no current price data available for the stocks in your portfolio. Since there is limited information on market conditions as well, it's best to maintain your current holdings until more data is available. 

I suggest keeping a close eye on any news or updates related to the micro-cap stocks in your portfolio, as well as monitoring overall market trends when making future decisions. 

Please let me know if you have any specific stocks in mind for potential purchases once more information becomes available.
