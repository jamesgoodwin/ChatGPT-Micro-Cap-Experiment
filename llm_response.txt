Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data on the stocks in your portfolio, I recommend the following actions:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - Given your cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential and undervalued prices to maximize your returns. Conduct thorough research and consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate risks.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are for now. However, once the data becomes available, reassess the positions and adjust the stop-loss levels accordingly to protect your gains.

Please conduct in-depth research on potential new positions and stay updated on market trends to make informed decisions for your portfolio. Remember, the goal is to generate maximum returns within the given timeframe. Good luck!
