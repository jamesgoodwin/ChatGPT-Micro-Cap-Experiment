2. Buy new positions with available cash ($7.43):
   - Look for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential and positive catalysts. Make sure to conduct thorough research before making any new purchases.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels (if necessary):
   - Since we don't have current price data for the stocks, it's essential to keep a close eye on any developments that may impact the positions. Adjust stop-loss levels accordingly based on new information.

Please conduct in-depth research before making any new investment decisions to maximize portfolio returns. Review the market conditions and news related to micro-cap stocks to stay informed and make informed choices. 

Thesis review for next week: Continue to focus on maximizing alpha by carefully selecting micro-cap stocks with growth potential and monitoring positions closely for any necessary adjustments.
