Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data, I recommend holding onto your current positions and maintaining the existing stop-loss levels for ATYR, BETR, CCLD, and CSBR.

Since there is limited information on market performance and stock movements, it would be prudent to wait for more data before making any significant changes to your portfolio. 

Please continue to monitor the market closely for any updates that may impact your holdings.
