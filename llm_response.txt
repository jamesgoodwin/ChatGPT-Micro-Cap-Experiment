Given the limited information available, I recommend holding your current positions until we can gather more data on the market and individual stocks. Since there is no current price data available for your holdings, it is difficult to make informed decisions on whether to buy, sell, or adjust stop-loss levels.

I suggest monitoring the market closely for any updates on the Russell 2000, SPDR S&P Biotech ETF, and S&P 500 indices to gauge overall market sentiment and trends. Once we have more information, we can reassess the portfolio and make strategic decisions accordingly.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this approach or if you have any specific preferences for how you would like to proceed with your portfolio in the absence of current price data.
