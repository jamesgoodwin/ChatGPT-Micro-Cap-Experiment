Given the current market conditions and your portfolio status as of 2026-02-18, here are my recommendations for today:

1. **Hold current positions:**
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01.

2. **Adjust stop-loss levels:**
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are for now. Once the price data is accessible, we can reassess and adjust accordingly.

3. **Hold cash balance:**
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, I suggest holding onto it for now until we have a clearer picture of the market and potential investment opportunities.
