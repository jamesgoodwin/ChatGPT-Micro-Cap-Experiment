Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data, I recommend holding onto your current positions for now. Since we do not have real-time price data, it is difficult to make informed decisions on buying, selling, or adjusting stop-loss levels. 

I suggest monitoring the market closely and being ready to act once we have access to updated information. It's important to stay patient and not make any hasty decisions without complete data. 

Please let me know if you have any specific criteria or preferences for potential new positions, so we can be prepared to act swiftly when the data becomes available.
