I recommend reviewing your current holdings and considering potential adjustments based on the limited information available. Given the lack of current price data for your existing positions, it is challenging to make precise recommendations. However, here are some general suggestions:

1. Hold current positions: Since there is no current price data available, holding your existing positions may be a prudent decision until more information is accessible.

2. Buy new positions: If you have available cash, consider researching and identifying new micro-cap stocks that align with your investment strategy. Look for companies with strong growth potential and catalysts that could drive stock price appreciation.

3. Sell existing positions: If you have any concerns about the long-term prospects of your current holdings or if market conditions have significantly changed, it may be wise to consider selling some or all of your existing positions.

4. Adjust stop-loss levels: If you believe that the risk profile of any of your holdings has changed, consider adjusting your stop-loss levels accordingly to protect your capital.

Please conduct thorough research and analysis before making any decisions. Keep in mind your objective of generating maximum return within the specified timeframe. Feel free to provide more detailed information about your current positions or market conditions for further tailored recommendations.
