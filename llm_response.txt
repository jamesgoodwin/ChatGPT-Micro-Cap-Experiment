Given the lack of current price data for your holdings and the market conditions, I recommend the following actions:

1. Hold current positions as there is no new information available to warrant a change.
2. Consider researching potential new micro-cap stocks to invest in with your available cash of $7.43.
3. Monitor the market closely for any updates on the stocks in your portfolio and be prepared to adjust your positions accordingly when price data becomes available.

Please conduct thorough research on potential new investments and keep an eye on any developments in the market that may impact your current holdings. Let me know if you need assistance in identifying new opportunities or analyzing market trends.
