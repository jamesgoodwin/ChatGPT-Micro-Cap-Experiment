Given the current market conditions and the lack of specific price data for your current holdings, it is challenging to provide precise recommendations. However, I suggest the following actions:

1. Hold current positions: 
   - Since we do not have real-time price data for ATYR, BETR, CCLD, and CSBR, it may be prudent to hold onto these positions until we have updated information on their performance.

2. Buy new positions:
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, you can consider looking for potential new micro-cap stocks to add to your portfolio. Conduct thorough research on promising candidates and consider diversifying your holdings to maximize returns.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Given the uncertainty in the market, it is crucial to review and potentially adjust the stop-loss levels for your existing positions once we have updated price data. This will help manage risk and protect your portfolio from significant losses.

Please keep an eye on market developments and be prepared to act swiftly based on new information. Remember to prioritize thorough research and risk management in your decision-making process.
