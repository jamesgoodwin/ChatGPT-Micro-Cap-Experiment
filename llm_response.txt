Based on the current portfolio status and market conditions, here are my recommendations for today:

1. **Hold current positions**: 
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01

2. **Adjust stop-loss levels**:
   - Since there is no current price data available, maintain the stop-loss levels at $0.01 for all positions until we have updated market information.

3. **Hold cash balance**: 
   - Keep the remaining cash balance of $7.43 for future opportunities.

Please note that without current price data, it is challenging to make precise decisions on buying or selling. It is recommended to monitor the market closely and adjust positions accordingly when data becomes available.
