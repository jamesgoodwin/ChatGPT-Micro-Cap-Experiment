Given the current market conditions and your portfolio status, here are my recommendations for today:

1. **Hold Current Positions:**
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01

2. **Adjust Stop-Loss Levels:**
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend adjusting the stop-loss levels for all positions to reflect a reasonable percentage below the last known price to protect your gains.

3. **Buy New Positions:**
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential to diversify your portfolio further. Consider conducting deep research to identify promising opportunities within the micro-cap space.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with these recommendations or if you have any specific preferences for new positions or adjustments.
