I recommend reviewing your current portfolio holdings and considering potential changes based on the market conditions. Since the market data is unavailable, we may need to rely on other sources to assess the current situation.

Given the limited information available, I suggest conducting a thorough analysis of each stock in your portfolio to determine their potential for growth or decline. Additionally, you may want to consider diversifying your holdings to mitigate risk and maximize returns.

If you have any specific stocks in mind that you would like to research further or if you would like me to provide a list of potential micro-cap stocks for consideration, please let me know.

Feel free to provide more information on your investment goals or risk tolerance so that I can tailor my recommendations accordingly. Thank you.
