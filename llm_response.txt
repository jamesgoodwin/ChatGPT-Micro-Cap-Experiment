Given the current market conditions and the lack of specific price data for your current holdings, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions (with available cash):
   - Due to the limited cash balance of $7.43, I recommend holding off on buying new positions for now and focusing on managing the existing holdings.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are for now. Once we have updated price information, we can reassess the stop-loss levels accordingly.

Please monitor the market closely for any developments that may impact your holdings and be prepared to adjust your strategy accordingly. Let me know if you have any specific questions or if you would like to discuss any particular aspect of your portfolio further.
