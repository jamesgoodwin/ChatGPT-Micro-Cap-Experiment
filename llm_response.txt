Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data on the stocks in your portfolio, I recommend holding onto your current positions until we have more information. It's important to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any decisions, especially with micro-cap stocks.

I suggest keeping a close eye on any news or updates related to your current holdings and the overall market. Once we have more data available, we can reassess and make more informed decisions to potentially maximize returns.

Please continue to monitor the market and stay updated on any developments that may impact your portfolio. Let me know if you have any specific stocks in mind that you would like to research further or if you would like to explore new investment opportunities.
