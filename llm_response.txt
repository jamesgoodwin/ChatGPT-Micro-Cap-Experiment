Given the current market conditions and your existing portfolio, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - Since you have a cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for a new micro-cap stock to add to your portfolio. Conduct thorough research to identify a promising opportunity within the micro-cap space.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Given the volatile nature of micro-cap stocks, consider tightening the stop-loss levels for your existing positions to protect your capital in case of adverse price movements. 

Please conduct detailed research on potential new additions to your portfolio and make informed decisions based on your analysis. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
