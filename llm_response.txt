Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data, I recommend holding onto your current positions for now. Since we don't have real-time market information, it's best to maintain your current holdings until we have more data to make informed decisions. 

If you have any specific stocks in mind that you would like to consider adding to your portfolio, please provide the names and I can assist you with further research and analysis. 

As always, continue monitoring the market closely for any updates that may impact your portfolio. Let me know if you have any specific questions or need further assistance.
