Given the current market conditions and the lack of available market data, I recommend holding onto your current positions for now. Without real-time price data, it is difficult to make informed decisions on buying, selling, or adjusting stop-loss levels.

Please continue to monitor the market closely and be prepared to act once data becomes available. If you have any specific criteria or preferences for new positions, please let me know so I can provide tailored recommendations in the future. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you would like further analysis once market data is accessible.
