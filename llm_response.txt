Given the lack of current price data for your holdings and market indices, it is challenging to make informed decisions. However, based on the last available information, here are my recommendations:

1. **Hold current positions**: 
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. **Adjust Stop-Loss Levels**:
   - Given the volatile nature of micro-cap stocks, consider tightening your stop-loss levels to protect your gains and limit potential losses.

3. **Review New Positions**:
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, consider researching and identifying new potential micro-cap stocks that align with your investment strategy. Ensure that your selections have a strong thesis and potential for alpha generation.

4. **Market Monitoring**:
   - Keep a close eye on market conditions and any news or developments that may impact your current holdings or potential new positions.

Please conduct thorough research and analysis before making any decisions. Remember to update your stop-loss levels and consider diversifying your portfolio to manage risk effectively. Let me know if you need further assistance or have any specific questions.
