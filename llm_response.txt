I recommend reviewing your current positions and considering potential adjustments based on the latest market conditions. Given the lack of current price data for your holdings, it's essential to stay vigilant and make informed decisions.

Here are some suggestions for your consideration:

1. **Hold Current Positions:** 
   - Continue monitoring your existing positions and be prepared to act once price data becomes available.

2. **Buy New Positions:**
   - With $7.43 in cash, you may consider looking for new micro-cap stocks that show potential for growth. Conduct thorough research before making any new purchases.

3. **Sell Existing Positions:**
   - Consider selling any holdings that no longer align with your investment strategy or show signs of underperformance. Keep an eye out for opportunities to reallocate capital to stronger prospects.

4. **Adjust Stop-Loss Levels:**
   - Review your stop-loss levels for existing positions and adjust them if necessary to manage risk effectively.

Remember to prioritize deep research and due diligence when making investment decisions. Feel free to provide specific trade instructions for any changes you wish to make. Stay proactive and adaptable in response to market developments.
