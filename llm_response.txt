Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data on your current holdings, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - Since you have a cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for new micro-cap stocks with potential for growth. Consider conducting thorough research to identify promising opportunities within your investment criteria.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Given the lack of current price data, it may be beneficial to reassess and potentially adjust your stop-loss levels for existing positions once market data becomes available.

Please ensure to monitor market developments closely and make informed decisions based on your research to maximize returns within the given timeframe. Feel free to reach out for further assistance or updates as needed.
