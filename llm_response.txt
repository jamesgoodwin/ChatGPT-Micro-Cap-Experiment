Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data, I recommend holding onto your current positions for now. Since we don't have real-time information on the stocks in your portfolio, it would be prudent to maintain your positions until we have more updated data to make informed decisions.

Once we have access to the latest market data, we can reassess and potentially make adjustments to your portfolio. In the meantime, I advise monitoring the market closely for any developments that may impact your holdings. 

Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or if you would like to discuss any other strategies.
