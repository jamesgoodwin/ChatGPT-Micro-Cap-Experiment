Given the current market conditions and the status of your portfolio, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop at $0.01
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop at $0.01
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop at $0.01
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop at $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - With the available cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for a new micro-cap stock with growth potential. Conduct deep research to identify a promising stock and provide specific trade instructions for the purchase.

3. No sell recommendations at this time.

4. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels at $0.01 for the existing positions until we have updated market information.

Please conduct thorough research before making any new purchases and ensure that the chosen stock aligns with your investment objectives. Let me know if you need further assistance or information.
