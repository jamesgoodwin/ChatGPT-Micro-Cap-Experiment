Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data, I recommend holding onto your current positions until we have more information on how the market is performing.

If you have any specific stocks in mind that you would like to research further or potentially add to your portfolio, please provide me with the ticker symbols so I can conduct a thorough analysis for you. 

As always, continue to monitor your current holdings and adjust stop-loss levels if necessary to protect your portfolio.
