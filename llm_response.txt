Given the current market conditions and your portfolio status, here are my recommendations for today:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01 (No current price data)
   - BETR: Hold 1 share with a stop-loss at $0.01 (No current price data)
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01 (No current price data)
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares with a stop-loss at $0.01 (No current price data)

2. Buy new positions:
   - Since you have $7.43 in cash, I recommend looking for new micro-cap stocks to diversify your portfolio. Please conduct thorough research and identify potential opportunities for investment.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - As we do not have current price data for the stocks in your portfolio, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels unchanged for now until we have updated information.

Please ensure to conduct detailed research before making any new investment decisions and consider the risk factors associated with micro-cap stocks. Let me know if you need further assistance or information.
