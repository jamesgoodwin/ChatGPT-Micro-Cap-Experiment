I would recommend reviewing the current positions and considering potential adjustments based on the market conditions. Since we do not have current price data for the holdings, it is difficult to assess their performance.

Given the limited cash balance of $7.43, it may be prudent to hold onto the current positions for now and wait for more information on the market conditions before making any significant changes.

If you would like to take on more risk, you could consider adding a new position in a promising micro-cap stock with growth potential. However, please ensure thorough research and analysis before making any new purchases.

Overall, I would suggest holding onto the current positions and monitoring market developments closely before making any further decisions.
