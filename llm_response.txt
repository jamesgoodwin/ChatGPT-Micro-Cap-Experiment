Given the lack of current price data for the stocks in your portfolio and the market indices, I recommend focusing on potential new positions to maximize returns within the micro-cap space.

With your cash balance of $7.43, I suggest looking for promising micro-cap stocks with high growth potential. Conduct thorough research to identify companies with strong fundamentals, upcoming catalysts, and positive industry trends.

Once you have identified potential new positions, please provide specific trade instructions including the stock ticker, number of shares to purchase, limit price, and any stop-loss levels if applicable.

Remember, your goal is to generate alpha, so prioritize stocks with significant growth opportunities in the current market environment. Good luck with your research and decision-making process!
