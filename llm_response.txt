Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data, I recommend holding onto your current positions for now. Without updated price information, it is difficult to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or adjusting stop-loss levels. It would be prudent to wait until we have more up-to-date market data before making any changes to your portfolio.

I will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide updated recommendations as soon as more information becomes available.
