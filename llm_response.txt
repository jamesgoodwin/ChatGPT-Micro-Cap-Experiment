Given the limited information available, I recommend the following actions for your current portfolio:

1. **Hold current positions:** 
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01

2. **Adjust stop-loss levels:** 
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels unchanged for now. However, once the price data becomes available, consider adjusting the stop-loss levels based on the new information.

3. **Hold Cash Balance:** 
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, it might be beneficial to keep some cash on hand for potential future opportunities or to cover any unforeseen circumstances.

Please note that without real-time market data, it is challenging to make precise recommendations. Keep a close eye on the market trends and be prepared to adjust your positions accordingly once more information is available.

Thesis Review: 
Given the lack of real-time market data, it is essential to monitor the situation closely and be prepared to act swiftly once the data becomes available. Holding current positions and maintaining a cautious approach with the available cash balance is advisable at this point.
