Given the current market conditions and the lack of available market data, I recommend holding onto your current positions for now. Without updated price information, it is difficult to make informed decisions on buying, selling, or adjusting stop-loss levels. 

I suggest monitoring the market closely and being prepared to make adjustments once data becomes available. Remember to stay patient and disciplined in your approach. 

If you have any specific stocks or sectors you are interested in, please let me know and I can provide more targeted recommendations once market data is accessible. 

Please feel free to reach out with any further questions or updates.
