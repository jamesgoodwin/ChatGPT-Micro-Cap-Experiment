Given the lack of current price data for your holdings and the market conditions, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions with available cash:
   - Since you have a cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential to diversify your portfolio further. Conduct thorough research and identify a promising stock to invest in.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels (once price data is available):
   - Once you have access to current price data for your holdings, consider adjusting the stop-loss levels based on any significant changes in stock prices or market conditions.

Remember to conduct in-depth research before making any investment decisions and to keep a close eye on market developments. Feel free to reach out for further assistance or updates on market data.
