Given the lack of current price data for the existing positions and market indices, it is challenging to make informed decisions. However, with the available cash balance of $7.43, we may consider buying new positions in potential micro-cap stocks.

I recommend conducting thorough research on potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth potential within the current market environment. Once you have identified promising opportunities, you can proceed with purchasing new positions to enhance the portfolio's potential for generating alpha.

Please ensure to maintain a diversified portfolio and consider setting appropriate stop-loss levels to manage risk effectively. Keep in mind the objective of maximizing returns within the specified timeframe.

Feel free to provide specific details on the new positions you are considering for purchase, including order type, limit pricing, and any other relevant instructions. We can then proceed with executing the trades accordingly.
