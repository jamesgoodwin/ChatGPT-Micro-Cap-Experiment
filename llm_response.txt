Given the current market conditions and the lack of specific price data for your current holdings, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions: 
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions: 
   - Since your cash balance is $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks that show strong growth potential and have a positive catalyst in the near future. Consider conducting thorough research to identify new opportunities for investment.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels: 
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are for now. However, once price data becomes available, reassess and adjust the stop-loss levels accordingly to manage risk effectively.

Please conduct thorough research and analysis before making any new investment decisions. Keep monitoring market conditions and stay updated on any developments that may impact your portfolio. Let me know if you need further assistance or specific trade instructions.
