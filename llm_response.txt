Given the current portfolio status and market conditions, here are my recommendations for today:

1. **Hold Current Positions**:
   - ATYR: Hold 5 shares @ $4.90 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - BETR: Hold 1 share @ $13.78 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CCLD: Hold 25 shares @ $2.59 with a stop-loss at $0.01.
   - CSBR: Hold 3 shares @ $6.47 with a stop-loss at $0.01.

2. **Adjust Stop-Loss Levels**:
   - Given the lack of current price data, it's important to review and potentially adjust the stop-loss levels for each position once the data becomes available.

3. **Buy New Positions**:
   - With $7.43 in cash, consider researching and identifying potential micro-cap stocks that align with your investment thesis to fully utilize available capital.

Overall, continue to monitor the market conditions closely and make adjustments as necessary based on updated information. Remember to conduct thorough research before making any new investment decisions.
