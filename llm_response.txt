Given the current market conditions and the lack of available price data for your current holdings, I recommend the following actions:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - With your available cash balance of $7.43, I recommend looking for potential micro-cap stocks with strong growth prospects. Conduct thorough research and consider adding a new position to further diversify your portfolio.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are for now. Once price data becomes available, reassess the positions and adjust stop-loss levels accordingly.

Please ensure to conduct detailed research before making any new investment decisions and consider the potential risks associated with micro-cap stocks. Let me know if you need further assistance or information.
