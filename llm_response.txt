Given the lack of current price data for your holdings and the market conditions, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I suggest keeping the stop-loss levels as they are until we have updated information.

3. Hold cash balance:
   - With a cash balance of $7.43, it might be beneficial to hold onto it for potential future opportunities in the micro-cap market.

Please note that without current price data, it is challenging to make informed decisions on buying or selling positions. I recommend monitoring the market closely for updates and adjusting your positions accordingly when more information becomes available.

Thesis Summary: The portfolio is currently holding positions in micro-cap stocks with a focus on generating alpha. The strategy revolves around deep research and strategic decision-making to maximize returns within the specified timeframe.
