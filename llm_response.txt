Given the current market conditions and the lack of available market data, I recommend holding onto your current positions for now. 

If you would like to consider new positions, I suggest conducting thorough research on potential micro-cap stocks and identifying opportunities that align with your investment strategy. 

Since there is limited information available, it may be prudent to maintain your current holdings until more market data becomes accessible. 

If you have any specific stocks in mind or additional information to share, please let me know so I can provide more tailored recommendations.
