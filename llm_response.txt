Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data for your current holdings, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold all current positions until we have more market data available to make informed decisions.
2. Consider conducting deep research on potential new micro-cap stocks to invest in once more information is available.
3. Keep a close eye on any news or developments in the micro-cap space that could impact your current holdings.

Since we have limited information at the moment, it's best to maintain a cautious approach and wait for more insights before making any significant changes to your portfolio. Feel free to reach out for further updates or guidance as more data becomes available.
