I am a professional-grade portfolio analyst. 

Given the current market conditions and the lack of price data for the stocks in your portfolio, I recommend the following actions:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since there is no current price data available, I recommend keeping the stop-loss levels as they are until we have more information.

3. Hold onto the cash balance of $7.43 for future opportunities.

Please note that without updated price data, it's challenging to make informed decisions about buying or selling stocks. I recommend monitoring the market closely for any updates and be prepared to act swiftly when the data becomes available.

Thesis review: The current portfolio is diversified across different micro-cap stocks, which can help mitigate risk. Moving forward, it will be essential to monitor the market closely and be ready to make adjustments based on new information.
