Given the lack of current price data for your holdings and the market conditions, I recommend the following actions for your portfolio:

1. Hold current positions:
   - ATYR: 5 shares @ $4.90 | Stop: $0.01
   - BETR: 1 share @ $13.78 | Stop: $0.01
   - CCLD: 25 shares @ $2.59 | Stop: $0.01
   - CSBR: 3 shares @ $6.47 | Stop: $0.01

2. Buy new positions:
   - With your available cash of $7.43, you may consider looking into potential micro-cap stocks with growth potential. Conduct deep research to identify promising opportunities and allocate your cash accordingly. Ensure that the stocks you choose align with your portfolio strategy and have strong potential for generating alpha.

3. Adjust stop-loss levels:
   - Since we do not have current price data, it's difficult to assess the need for adjusting stop-loss levels. However, once we have updated information, it would be prudent to reassess the stop-loss levels for each position based on the price movements and risk tolerance.

Please conduct thorough research before making any new investment decisions and stay updated on market conditions to maximize returns and manage risks effectively. Let me know if you need further guidance or have any specific preferences for new positions.
