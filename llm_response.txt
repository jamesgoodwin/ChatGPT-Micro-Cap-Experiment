Given the lack of current price data for your holdings and the market conditions, I recommend the following:

1. **Hold current positions:** Since we do not have real-time data for ATYR, BETR, CCLD, and CSBR, it would be prudent to hold onto your current positions until we receive updated information on their performance.

2. **Adjust stop-loss levels:** Given the volatile nature of micro-cap stocks, I recommend adjusting your stop-loss levels for each position to protect any potential gains. Consider setting tighter stop-loss levels to mitigate downside risk.

3. **Monitor market conditions:** Keep a close eye on market conditions and any news that may impact your micro-cap holdings. Stay informed to make timely decisions if necessary.

Once we have updated price data and market information, we can reassess the portfolio and make more informed decisions. Remember to prioritize risk management and stay disciplined in your approach.
