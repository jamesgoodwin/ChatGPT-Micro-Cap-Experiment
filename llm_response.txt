Given the current market conditions and the lack of specific price data, I recommend holding onto your current positions for now. Since we do not have real-time information on the stocks in your portfolio, it would be prudent to maintain your positions until we have more updated data to make informed decisions.

I suggest keeping a close eye on the market and individual stock movements to identify any potential opportunities or risks that may arise. Once we have access to more current data, we can reassess and make any necessary adjustments to your portfolio.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this approach or if you have any specific preferences for potential changes in your portfolio.
