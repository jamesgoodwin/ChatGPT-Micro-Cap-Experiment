Given the current market conditions and the lack of available data, I recommend holding onto your current positions for now. Since we don't have real-time price data, it's best to wait for more information before making any new moves. 

If you have any specific stocks in mind that you would like to research further or if you want to adjust your stop-loss levels, please let me know so we can make informed decisions. 

Let's continue monitoring the market and be ready to act when we have more information available.
